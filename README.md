![image](https://github.com/Jordy3D/BaneVTube/blob/main/kat.gif)  |  Based on work from [EmilianaVT's OpenSeeFace project](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace), this is a currently editor-only tool for Vtubing.  A build will be released when I get around to working on VRM importing, but until then it can be done manually in-engine.  


This project features: 
- face-tracking via OpenSeeFace (currently lacking emotions) 
- a number of post-procesing effects
- some simple controls for changing the model and camera postion and rotation
- direct webcam OUTput, to be used as a Camera Input for OBS, SLOBS, Discord, Zoom, etc

An example of it being used can be seen [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1026700819?t=02h42m15s), however I really need to record a better example thanks to Discord shifting the input Mic without me noticing (mistakes happen!)
